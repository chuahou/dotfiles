Dotfiles
########

This repo contains my own dotfiles with scripts.

Scripts are found at
`chuahou/dotfiles-scripts <https://github.com/chuahou/dotfiles-scripts>`_.
This repo will only contain the orginal development commits for the scripts, as
well as summary commits copying updates from dotfiles-scripts.

Scripts under MIT licence.

Cloning with submodules
=======================

Some essential parts (for now the `zsh-vim-mode plugin
<https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode>`_) are added as submodules.
Make sure to clone using

::

	git clone https://github.com/chuahou/dotfiles --recursive

Otherwise, if already cloned without submodules, run

::

	git submodule update --init
